# Where is Kevlin?

An app to determine where [@kevlinhenney][] is (or, indeed, anyone who tweets their
location with the same, consistent format)

# Usage

```
export TWITTER_API_KEY="<API_KEY>"
export TWITTER_API_SECRET="<API_SECRET>"
go build
./whereiskevlin
```

# Status

Hacked together version so I've got something to point to for the [ACCU2019][]
lightning talks.

# Why?

There should be a video of the [ACCU2019][] lightning talks which might explain
it until such point as I get more time.
